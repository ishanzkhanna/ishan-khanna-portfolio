Developed a metadata-driven search tool that allows users to search columns and view their lineage across multiple tables and pipelines.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Apache Spark
- Azure Data Factory
- SQL

## Architecture
Metadata ingestion → Processing → Lineage mapping → Search interface

## Impact
- Reduced investigation time by ~40%
- Improved data trust and transparency
